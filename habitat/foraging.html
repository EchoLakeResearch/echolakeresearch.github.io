<h1 class="title">Foraging</h1>
</div>
<p>Imagine walking into a garden right now, TODAY, and having food fresher and more nutritious than anything you can get in the store. Gently lifting peppery microgreens, snapping off crisp, juicy leaves for a salad. Picking berries with more antioxidants than blueberries, or gathering a a refreshing herbal tea. Maybe mushrooms for a stir fry, if it is the rainy season.</p>
<p>Well… you already live in the middle of this garden! Everything little piece of we call “nature” is our habitat, from old growth forests to weedy strips in a city. It is time to recover our birthright to be abundantly cared for by nature and to care for it in turn. It is as close as opening our eyes and walking out the door, with just a little knowledge to guide us.</p>
<p>At this point we would like to make a bold claim: harvesting wildgrown food and medicine is one of the most practical and important things a person can do in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Actually, we lied. This is not a bold claim at all, just a surprising one to modern ears. Harvesting the wilds has always been fundamental to healthy existence as human beings. It remains true even though we tend to forget when we have lives overly defined by agriculture or excess civilization. As individuals and societies, we have much to gain from remembering who we are.</p>
<p>If you are ready to dive right in, you can <a href="#start">skip to the “Get started foraging”</a> section.</p>

<p>Continue in the section <a href="#saving-money">“Saving money by foraging”</a> for more.</p>
<p>Foraging isn’t just about high quality free food, though. Spending time outside is linked to a host of emotional, mental, and physical benefits. We don’t need the studies to tell us, though - think of how you feel after going for a pleasant walk, or a meander through your backyard. Then compare that feeling to fighting traffic and lines at the grocery store. The very act of foraging will nudge you towards being a more balanced, happier, and healthier person, and with deliberate embrace of that the effect is even stronger.</p>
<p><a href="#health">&gt; Foraging and Health &lt;</a></p>
<p>I won’t claim that you can stop grocery shopping if you start foraging. But you can certainly cut your grocery bills, have better quality and more deeply flavored food to boot. There is a groundswell of interest in high-quality food these days, and it is a good thing. It is easier than ever to find organic food, or to shop at a local farmers market. But wild foods beat all that, hands down.</p>
<p><a href="#quality">&gt; Foraging and food quality &lt;</a></p>
<p>The simplicity is deceptive. There are very few things we can do that are as transformative as foraging!</p>
<h2 id="start">Get started foraging</h2>
<p>The idea of this section is to get you a quick START. Adopting foraging into your lifestyle won’t happen by reading about it, but by doing it. Fortunately, there are a number of very common plants that make good food, so you don’t need an entire botanical education to begin. And as you forage, you will gradually come to know the other plants that grow in your area, and have a richer and richer pallete of foods to select from.</p>
<h3 id="safety-first">Safety first</h3>
<p>Let’s start with some simple rules to keep you and your habitat safe and give you a good experience. Fortunately again, this is not complicated!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do not eat anything if you do not know what it is. This should be easy to remember… so please remember it! And if you do put something in your mouth and realize it tastes wrong, just spit it out. You will be quite safe if you follow this rule.</li>
<li>Don’t gather anything unless it is clearly locally abundant, and then not more than 10%. This protects plant populations, and leaves food for birds, animals, and your fellow foragers.</li>
<li>As you learn which plants are native and which are invasive, you can over-harvest invasives to keep them in check, and sow seeds for natives among them.</li>
<li>Have an attitude of exploration and gratitude. Even if you find no food or medicine there is plenty to be thankful for with fresh air and the chance to move your body.</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning in person is a great way to go. You can email jason@echolakeresearch.org to get notified of when we will be doing foraging walks.</p>
<p>If you were to buy and cherish only one book on foraging, make it Wild Wisdom of Weeds by Katrina Blair - <a href="https://wildfoodgirl.com/2015/katrina-blairs-wild-wisdom-of-weeds/">check out this informative review</a>. Just the review that is itself is an education! This book covers 13 of the most common, resilient, nutritious plants that grow across the entire planet, including here in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Another simple, amazingly useful book is Botany in a Day, which the author has <a href="Learn%20how%20to%20figure%20out%20what%20family%20a%20plant%20is%20in%20by%20watching%20this%20excellent%2045%20minute%20video:%20[Botany%20in%20Day%20Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1DePlU15z4)">summarized in a 45 minute tutorial video</a>.</p>
<p>If you use Facebook, one of the easiest ways to boost your knowledge of foraging is to join a couple active, local groups. Members post what they are finding, so you can get a seasonal education about wild foods, and you can ask questions and get guidance. The two most active ones I know of are:</p>

<h3 id="our-natural-habitat">Our natural habitat</h3>
<p>Our habitat is our home, and foraging is far more personal and intimate than shopping. So instead of foraging like we are on a trip to the store, we can forage like we are opening the door of a well stocked pantry. Or a carefully supplied medicine cabinet. There is a feeling of cozy satisfaction that comes from having everything you need stored up, and eventually you will get a similar feeling from walking out your front door.</p>
<p>Our habitat is a magical pantry, though. When we recieve from it in the right ways, it thrives and will give us back ten times more. We earn the right ways to scatter seeds, wisely prune, transplant, and take cuttings. But when we take greedily from the magical pantry, it becomes barren.</p>
