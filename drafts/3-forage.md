title: Foraging
---

Imagine walking into a garden right today and having fresh, wonderful food available for you to pick. Gently lifting peppery microgreens, or snapping off crisp, juicy leaves for a salad. Picking berries with more antioxidants than blueberries, or putting together a refreshing and medicinal herbal tea. Maybe collecting mushrooms for a stir fry, if it is the rainy season.

Well... you already live in the middle of this garden! Everything little piece of we call "nature" is our habitat, from old growth forests to weedy strips in a city. It is as close as opening our eyes and walking out the door, and it just takes a little knowledge and some practice. If you are ready to dive right in, you can [go right to the "Get started foraging"](#start) section.

There is rich variety to be found in nature, and new flavors and aromas to explore - the deep terroir of the land we call home. There is no better way to experience the distinctive flavor of our region than by using the plants that naturally thrive here, and integrating them into everyday life.

Foraging isn't just about high quality local food, though. It is also an economical, one

Foraging isn't just about high quality free food, though. Spending time outside is linked to a host of emotional, mental, and physical benefits. We don't need the studies to tell us, though - think of how you feel after going for a pleasant walk, or a meander through your backyard. Then compare that feeling to fighting traffic and lines at the grocery store. The very act of foraging will nudge you towards being a more balanced, happier, and healthier person, and with deliberate embrace of that the effect is even stronger.

I won't claim that you can stop grocery shopping if you start foraging. But you can certainly cut your grocery bills, have better quality and more deeply flavored food to boot. There is a groundswell of interest in high-quality food these days, and it is a good thing. It is easier than ever to find organic food, or to shop at a local farmers market. But wild foods beat all that, hands down.

## Get started foraging{#start}

The idea of this section is to get you a quick START. Adopting foraging into your lifestyle won't happen by reading about it, but by doing it. Fortunately, there are a number of very common plants that make good food, so you don't need an entire botanical education to begin. And as you forage, you will gradually come to know the other plants that grow in your area, and have a richer and richer pallete of foods to select from.

### Safety first

Let's start with some simple rules to keep you and  your habitat safe and give you a good experience. Fortunately again, this is not complicated!

1. Do not eat anything if you do not know what it is. This should be easy to remember... so please remember it! And if you do put something in your mouth and realize it tastes wrong, just spit it out. You will be quite safe if you follow this rule.
2. Don't gather anything unless it is clearly locally abundant, and then not more than 10%. This protects plant populations, and leaves food for birds, animals, and your fellow foragers.
3. As you learn which plants are native and which are invasive, you can over-harvest invasives to keep them in check, and sow seeds for natives among them.
4. Have an attitude of exploration and gratitude. Even if you find no food or medicine there is plenty to be thankful for with fresh air and the chance to move your body.

### Resources to learn more

Learning in person is a great way to go. You can email jason@echolakeresearch.org to get notified of when we will be doing foraging walks.

If you were to buy and cherish only one book on foraging, make it Wild Wisdom of Weeds by Katrina Blair - [check out this informative review](https://wildfoodgirl.com/2015/katrina-blairs-wild-wisdom-of-weeds/). Just the review that is itself is an education! This book covers 13 of the most common, resilient, nutritious plants that grow across the entire planet, including here in the Pacific Northwest.

Another simple, amazingly useful book is Botany in a Day, which the author has [summarized in a 45 minute tutorial video](Learn how to figure out what family a plant is in by watching this excellent 45 minute video: [Botany in Day Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1DePlU15z4)).

If you use Facebook, one of the easiest ways to boost your knowledge of foraging is to join a couple active, local groups. Members post what they are finding, so you can get a seasonal education about wild foods, and you can ask questions and get guidance. The two most active ones I know of are:

## Discovering local flavor

One of the joys of food is to experience the distinct flavors that come from different regions. The most famous example of this may be the distinctive terroir of fine wines, where the climate, soil, and cultural practices of the vineyard leave an indelible fingerprint on the wine. Anything grown in a region will have its fingerprint, to a degree. The fullest terroir comes from what grows naturally in a place - the living things that have shaped themselves to the land and the climate, and the history and stories that make them the way they are.

## Finding Health

- high concentrations of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals like antioxidants
- forest bathing, social interaction
- medicinal properties

### Our natural habitat

Our habitat is our home, and foraging is far more personal and intimate than shopping. So instead of foraging like we are on a trip to the store, we can forage like we are opening the door of a well stocked pantry. Or a carefully supplied medicine cabinet. There is a feeling of cozy satisfaction that comes from having everything you need stored up, and eventually you will get a similar feeling from walking out your front door.

Our habitat is a magical pantry, though. When we recieve from it in the right ways, it thrives and will give us back ten times more. We earn the right ways to scatter seeds, wisely prune, transplant, and take cuttings. But when we take greedily from the magical pantry, it becomes barren.

## Saving money

- high antioxidant, high vitamin and mineral stuff is by far the most expensive food at the store, especially if you want organic. Look for high ROI foraging

Foraging high value, high nutrition food & medicine.
