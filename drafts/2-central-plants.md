I'm working on a list of keystone plants that could be used to plant extremely resilient natural gardens in our region, and I'd love your feedback! Anything in here discordant? Am I missing something? I include a few trees that are either short or intended for coppice. A list of important food trees is different topic entirely.

Basically, these are plants that will thrive with little more care than being planted in the correct place, and are generally not too picky about what it means to be in the right place. Plants that will produce abundantly for us and other life with just a little tending. This is *extremely* rough and unsophisticated, and over time I hope to refine this list into a set of self-supporting plant communities and pairing recommendations.

I am not pretending this is a "most important plants" list or anything like that, just something workable I can use to prioritize *my own* efforts of education, distribution, and crop breeding.

I am aiming for a short list of mostly indigenous plants and small trees/bushes that as a set can provide the backbone of a delicious cuisine and be equally grown in the space of an ordinary suburban yard or on the scale of a watershed ecosystem restoration project. Or even better... plants that can be grown in people's yards as part of culture-driven ecosystem restoration that erases the divide between "ecosystem" and "yard" and yield abundant food, medicine, and more for all, human or not.

Heh, this is my personal list, and it would be misleading to pretend this is an overly analytical process. Intuition is a large part of where this list is coming from. With that caveat, here are some of the ideas I've been able to see my intuition chewing on. ;)

1. Indigeneity. Using the plants that have fed the people of this land forever hits a lot of points. Respect, resilience, deeply authentic terroir, coherent beauty, native pollinator support, and more than I can possibly list.We can learn gardening and foraging at the same time. The plants on this list are already widely distributed in our region, and can be ethically propagated from wild stands for free.  Using indigenous plants helps erase the fake line between gardening and ecosystem restoration. As many of these plants are wild they do not yield as many pounds as domesticated exotics, but they have more flavor, vitamins, and minerals per pound so we don't need as much! 

2. Deliciousness. For all the obvious reasons! Food can be a joy, and our region is abundant with delightful flavors that are inextricably tied to this place. That is worth celebrating, and worth planting!

3. Resilience. Some plants are more picky than others - I'm looking for plants that are bulletproof, and care little about late frosts or early frosts, drought, rain, storm, pests, disease or anything else. Climate is changing, and so plants that have a wide band of adaptation centered around this region lets us hedge our bets. Ability to fix nitrogen and thrive on severely degraded soils is a big plus.

4. Beauty. The plants on this list are strikingly beautiful, and as most of them are native plants we can have gardens with a beauty that is deeply resonant with the broader patterns of our region.

5. Perenniality. I love annual plants, but they are not the focus of this list. Perennial plants often yield during more months of the year, once established take much less time to manage than annuals, and are more resilient to distribute because in most cases it takes less skill and fuss to plant a division or cutting than to baby along seeds.

6. Year-round harvestability. For food production to fit into modern busy lifestyles it has to be flexible. A mad scramble at the end of the season to harvest, can, dry, pickle and freeze limits most people to eating from their garden just during  growing season. So the ideal is to have plants on this list that can be directly harvested in the winter, or at the very least be harvested in the fall but stored someplace like a garage with no fuss. Many or all of the perennial vegetables can have roots dug in the winter to sprout for fresh greens through the dark months.

7. Speediness. Our communities could use massively more edible plants growing, so the more easily and quickly these can be propagated out and the sooner they bear abundant food the better. Propagation by cuttings, tubers, and divisions lends itself well to neighbor-to-neighbor spread, and seed production lends itself to bulk production. Some of my very favorite plants don't make this list because they are fiddly to propagate, don't transplant well, or take many years to bear.

8. Medicinal quality. In making a list of food plants... coincidentally I've noticed that almost all of them are also valued as medicinal plants. My notes mostly cover the food uses, but there is a vast pharmacopoeia contained within as well.

9. Everything else! Many / most of these plants are valuable pollen and nectar sources, sources of material for making things with, and more. A book could be written on each of these plants, and that wouldn't touch the cultural knowledge of the indigenous people who have always lived with, tended and used these and hundreds more plants.

And so here are the plants I have so far on my draft list. Unless noted otherwise these are native to the lands around the Salish Sea.

FIELD MINT - Mentha arvensis
Native mint! Lovely, delicious mint. Useful for teas, medicine... and as a flavorful leafy green vegetable! One of the joys of using indigenous plants like this one is that they are widely variable. So the ancient story of the place you harvest a cutting from to grow in your garden will impact the flavor of all the food you make with it. This is deep, deep terroir.

NETTLE - Urtica dioica
Absolutely delicious for steamed greens and packed with vitamins and minerals, also makes nutritious crunchy little seeds and a spinnable fiber this is one of the most versatile plants on this list. This is one of the most noted medicinal plants on this list as well.

BLACKCAP RASPBERRY - Rubus Leucodermis
This berry has unbelievably rich flavor, and is easy to manage in the garden. The light colored canes are a striking visual statement in the wintertime. Like most raspberries these are easy and quick to propagate. The other native Rubus species like thimbleberries, salmonberries, and trailing blackberries are also excellent and taken together give a broad harvesting window for berries. The peeled shoots are also a great springtime vegetable.

BEAKED HAZELNUT - Corylus cornuta
Hazelnuts do take a few years to bear, but as a shrubby tree once established they will produce delicious food for many, many years. One of few highly resilient plant sources of oil in our region. Can be propagated easily from seed or from stooling / layering.

SPRINGBANK CLOVER - Trifolium wormskioldii
Did you know we have a true native clover? This is probably the least widely distributed species on this list. As a nitrogen fixing ground cover it has a crucial contribution to make in the natural garden, and it has beautiful flowers. Most notably for human uses it has crisp roots that are rumored to taste like pea shoots.

NODDING ONION - Allium cernuum
All parts of this garlic/onion relative are edible, from the greens and flowers to the bulbs. It is a beautiful accent plant in the garden. Reproduces from seed, but as a perennial bulbing plant once it is growing it can be easily shared around. Will self-seed in the right conditions.

SUNROOT aka Jerusalem Artichoke - Helianthus tuberosum
This is native to the eastern part of the continent. It grows as many calories per acre as potatoes, but the tubers store well in the ground. So it can be harvested as needed throughout the fall, winter and early spring as a staple crop. It produces ample biomass to contribute heavily to soil fertility, which is critical for staple crops.

BLACK ELDERBERRY - Sambucus nigra
This species is found in the Cascade mountains, and also in Europe. Cultivars are available that bear excellently, and this has capacity as a flavoring and as an excellent, science-and-tradition-backed antiviral medicine. Propagates very easily by cuttings.

WINE CAP MUSHROOM - Stropharia rugosannulata
Psych, this one isn't a plant! But once this native fungi is established in garden beds, it will live in the soil indefinitely and produce healthy, delicious protein and healthy soil. Needs the garden beds to be fed yearly with organic matter... which garden beds need anyway!

WINTER STORAGE APPLES and PEARS - Malus domestica, Pyrus spp.
These go against many of the I have for this list, but are massively useful enough to warrant inclusion. Apples and pears that are highly resistant to pests and diseases in our region and store in a garage with no fuss through the spring allow us to easily have fresh fruit from the garden 12 months of the year.

OREGON GRAPE - Mahonia spp.
One of the few plants that shines when planted under conifers, the tart berries can be used in many ways. The fresh green growth in springtime adds a wonderful spriteliness to salads, and the roots or bark can make very powerful medicinal teas. Can be propagated by seed, or layering branches.

FIREWEED - Chamaenerion angustifolium
Not only does this plant have long-lived, showy flower spikes that are heavenly for bees, but the shoots are a fine spring vegetable, and a wonderful tea can be made from the mature leaves and flowers.

PERENNIAL KALE - Brassica oleracea ramosa
One of the non-native inclusions, and rather rare. But it is one of the very easiest sources of large quantities of fresh greens through the winter and early spring. I recommend Homesteader's Kaleidoscopic Perennial Kale Grex, which has a lot of genetic diversity and is well-suited to local adaptation.

DANDELION - Taraxacum officinale
Widely labeled as an introduced species, I have it on authority I personally trust that there were dandelions here before Europeans arrived. In any case, dandelions are now 100% naturalized here, and their only invasiveness is of monoculture lawns. Every part of the plant is edible, and they can be prepared in a myriad of ways, and roots can be dug to force crisp blanched shoots through the winter. Deep taproots can be used to break up compacted soil.

GREYBERRY CURRANT - Ribes bracteosum
There are several native species of currants that are at home in the garden that are widely valued by indigenous peoples. Can tolerate some shade and still bear fruit. The berries as long clusters on a central stem, making harvest efficient and quick. Trailing Black Currant (Ribes laxiflorum) is also highly valued.

YARROW - Achillea millefolium
Useful as a flavoring agent, but most powerful as a medicine and as food and attractant for various pollinators and other tiny living things.

DOCK - Rumex spp.
We have several native species of dock which produce fine taproots for food, medicine, and busting up compacted soil. The leaves are one of the first sources of greens available in later winter or early spring, and can be dug for forcing indoors. The seeds are also edible.

PLANTAIN - Plantago spp.
When grown in moist, good soil the leaves of broadleaved or narrow leaved plantain can be used as cooked greens, or chopped small and used fresh in salads. They also make the seeds from which pysillium fiber is derived. Absolutely fabulous medicine with many many uses.

SEA BUCKTHORN - Hippophae rhamnoides
This is one of the most distantly originating plants on the list, being native to Europe and Asia. I am including it here because if it is given sun it can handle terrible soils, harsh conditions, fixes its own nitrogen, it propagates readily by suckering but is not invasive by seed, and it copiously produces berries that are delicious... and also high enough in healthy fats to be another source of fat from plants. Useable perennial oil sources in our climate are rare, and this is probably the most bulletproof.

HEAL ALL - Prunella vulgaris
This perennial, spreading plant in the mint family can be eaten in salads, but it can tend towards being a little bitter when raw and is most tasty when cooked. It can grow in extremely bad soils, and is often found growing on old gravel driveways. Extremely useful medicinal plant, as evidenced by the name!

AUTUMN OLIVE - Elaeagnus umbellata
This is not invasive west of the cascades in Washington state, BUT DO NOT PLANT east of the mountains! This grows quickly into a shrubby tree, fixes nitrogen, can handle harsh conditions, and heavily yields very nutritionally dense and tasty berries. It can be harvest by shaking branches, and propagated easily by cuttings. This might be the most resilient, productive, and low-labor source of fruit that we can grow here.

RED ALDER - Alnus rubra
Culinary usefulness is mostly for smoking, which is a marvelous dimension of flavor we could stand to use more! Also has medicinal properties, but the main role of growing these in the garden would be as a coppice - to let the trees grow for a few years to become established, then cut them to the ground regularly. As a quick growing nitrogen fixer red alder can be used to provide woody biomass that helps build and maintain deep, rich soil, and is an excellent fuel wood. Willows (Salix spp) and Black Cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) can also fill this role similarly, albeit with their own characteristics and medicine to offer.

OYSTER MUSHROOM - Pleurotus ostreatus
Widespread native mushroom that grows well on red alder wood. Also not a plant, but complements Wine Cap mushrooms nicely with its ability to directly decompose fresh wood. Wine Cap prefers material that has already been decomposed, and can come and clean up what the Oyster mushrooms leave behind. Thanks to a number of people who suggested this!

EDIBLE THISTLE - Cirsium edule
Another plant to grow on terrible, compacted soil, and tolerant of wildly varying and harsh conditions. The young shoots of this thistle can be peeled for a very delicate and delicious spring treat, and if grown in soil that can be dug the first year taproots can be harvested as a rootcrop. The seeds are edible as well!

WILD STRAWBERRIES - Fragaria spp.
There are several wild strawberry species around, and they are an early source of fruit in the year. Small berries, but incredibly good flavor and sweetness, and a solid contribution to the ground cover layer. Thanks [Nicole Aldergroves](https://www.facebook.com/nicole.aldergroves?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARBEZ7BiDuEjiImH1wngdlwtP935wjYd_8hkQqysYVLYYctb4QO1elFJkc7UI3LS5XXnxqB95fP9DAqa&fref=mentions)!

So... about native plants (including long-since naturalized plants) versus recently introduced plants. I have ZERO judgements about using plants new to our region, and some of my favorites are recent introductions or exotics. If I visit your garden and it is full of beautiful, delicious plants that thrive well here it will make me happy, and I won't care where they came from.

On a personal level, I find great beauty and connection in working with plants that have been here long enough to be deeply interwoven with the history and cultures of this place. Bill Mollison said that "Constraints can inspire creative design. We are surrounded by insurmountable opportunities", and I personally am testing out a constraint of - for the most part - using native plants.

I think that there is a deeply connected regional cuisine with as-yet untasted flavors that integrates with modern lives and modern tastes waiting for us to uncover it, and that insurmountable opportunity is exciting.

Also, I want a tighter integration between my gardening, foraging, and ecosystem restoration work. The more I am gardening with and mass propagating plants that fit in all three of those worlds, the more freely I can just tend the land without trying to context switch.
