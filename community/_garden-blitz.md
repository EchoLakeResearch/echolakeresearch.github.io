# What is a garden blitz?

A garden blitz is much like a classic barn-raising: community coming together to help each other! In this case, it is community coming together for a day to help install a brand new garden.

When we do a garden blitz, we will invite the general public to learn, and to help! It will be an installation and also a hands-on workshop, so we can keep spreading the knowledge.

# Awesome - Sign me up!

Great! We would love to help you with your garden blitz for free. Contact jason@echolakeresearch.org to see if it is a good fit and to get rolling on the details. In short, a blitz will involve:

- Working out a design for the garden
- Arranging logistics for the day, and gathering required materials and plants
- Recruiting volunteers and making it happen!
