<h1 class="title">Echo Lake Research</h1>
</div>
<p>Our mission is to help the Echo Lake neighborhood and surrounding communities connect together around better food, stronger community and more resilient living. We offer free how-to guides (some now, more coming!) and online webinars, and lead foraging walks and hands-on workshops. You can sign up to <a href="https://eepurl.com/gg_Oev">get updates via email</a> or on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EchoLakeResearch/">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Our emphasis is on finding practices that are easy to learn, forgiving to put into practice, and simple enough to become part of ordinary life. Read on to learn about the focus areas we are working on!</p>

<p>The best food is homemade, and we find ways to make it easy. We mostly cook without recipes, instead using simple patterns so that the food can flexibly adapt to what is in the garden and fridge. Sourdough bread, lactofermented veggies, kombucha and homebrew all have places of honor in our kitchen, and we have beautifully simplified ways to do all of those things.</p>

<p>We use a variety of approaches to make gardening more rewarding less work. Building living soil allows less watering, learning edible weeds changes them from a problem into a harvest, and sowing thick polycultures allows a leisurely style of plant once, harvest continually gardening. Growing fertility in the garden saves money on buying compost or fertilizers, and preserving an intact ecosystem and growing locally adapted seeds solves insect issues.</p>

</div>
<p>Probably the most bang for the buck growing food at home is in an orchard planted like a natural ecosystem. By using natural patterns we can almost entirely do away with weeding, significantly reduce pest issues, provide fertility, and harvest much more food! Because far more than just fruit and nut trees, our orchards can hold an enormous variety of annual and perennial vegetables, herbs, berry bushes pollinator plants, vines, ground covers, and root crops. This style of orchard is often called a “food forest” or a “forest garden”, but unlike our native PNW forests, these orchards typically have a savannah-like distribution of trees to allow sun to filter through on all the other plants.</p>
