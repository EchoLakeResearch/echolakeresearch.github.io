<h1 class="title">Common Weeds</h1>
</div>
<p>Many of the common weeds we fight in our gardens are actually more valuable than what we grow in their place! Learning how to appreciate and <em>use</em> the plants that grow wild on their own is the simplest way to save time in the garden and get more yield from it.</p>
<p>First we will cover some general information about safety, medicinal uses of weeds and how to get the most out of their flavors - scroll down for the list of great weeds!</p>
<p>If you like all this and want more, we highly recommend the book “The Wild Wisdom of Weeds: 13 Essential Plants for Human Survival” by Katrina Blair. It is fun to read and packed with valuable information.</p>
<h1 id="safety-first">Safety first</h1>
<p>Any time you are gathering, preparing and eating food that is new to you, you should be careful. This goes just as much for things you buy from the grocery store as it does things that grow in the garden!</p>
<ul>
<li>NEVER consume any plant that you are not absolutely certain of. There are tasty-looking wild plants that can hurt or kill you. The best way to learn plant ID is in person from a knowledgeable forager. This page has some pictures, but is a guide to uses, not to identification.</li>
<li>When first trying a new food, eat just a bit and wait awhile to make sure you don’t have an allergic reaction or intolerance to it.</li>
<li>If identifying a plant by yourself, check at least three reliable references. Pay very close attention to details, and don’t use it unless you are certain.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="medicine">Medicine</h1>
<p>Many of our most common weeds are also revered traditional medicinal herbs. The best way to get started doing herbal medicine with the wild plants around you is to pick one and to get to know it well. After you have learned how to integrate it into your regular life, pick another! A great plant to start with is plantain.</p>
<p>There are many uses for this plant, but one of the simplest is for treating be stings or simple scratches. Chew up a leaf and press it against the wound and healing will be sped up significantly.</p>
<p>Another good candidate is Heal All, or Self Heal, aka Prunella vulgaris. This native plant is very common, often found growing as a weed in driveways and lawns. As its name indicates is good medicine for many things! It can be made into teas, tinctures, balms, and poultices… and most simply it can be eaten in salads or cooked. The flowers make a beautiful edible garnish!</p>
<h1 id="delicious-food">Delicious Food</h1>
<p>Many wild plants are good eating but have more taste to them than most modern cuisine. Here are a few tips for using those flavors to make great food: - When making salad, use about 30% wild greens and herbs, and 70% normal domesticated greens. The bitterness of the wild greens will play off of your dressing and add depth of flavor without being overwhelming. - Cook wild greens as “potherbs”. Add a splash of vinegar to a pot of boiling water, then add various wild greens. Let cook till tender then rinse with cold water. Dress with olive oil, salt and pepper, and another dash of vinegar. Mmm! - When cooking, try robust flavors like curry powder, mediterranean seasoning, all-but-the-bagel or other favorite spice blends.</p>
<h1 id="a-selection-of-weeds">A selection of weeds</h1>
<h3 id="dandelion">Dandelion</h3>
<h4 id="taraxacum-officinale"><em>Taraxacum officinale</em></h4>
<p>Dandelions can have toothed or smooth leaves, but all of them are good eating. The mildest, best leaves are found when they grow in moist, shady conditions with fertile soil. The roots can be cut up and added to stir fries, and the flowers are famously used for dandelion wines and jellies.</p>
<h3 id="western-dock">Western Dock</h3>
<h4 id="rumex-occidentalis"><em>Rumex occidentalis</em></h4>
<p>Dock is one of the most prolific native perennial vegetables and medicines in our region! The leaves can be slow cooked like collards (add a dash of vinegar to the water while cooking). The yellow, potent roots can be used to make digestive bitters, or steeped in milk with spices for a PNW version of golden milk.</p>
<h3 id="plantain">Plantain</h3>
<h4 id="plantago-major-plantago-lanceolata"><em>Plantago major &amp; Plantago Lanceolata</em></h4>
<p>This is one of the foremost medical plants found anywhere in the world, and it is also one of the most humble and common. It can withstand deeply compacted soils and vehicle traffic, so it is often found in gravel driveways and on roadsides, but when it finds rich deep soil it will grow large and lush. The leaves are cooked like collard greens or chopped fine for fresh salad, and the seeds can be gathered and used like sesame seeds.</p>
<h3 id="mallow">Mallow</h3>
<h4 id="malva-species"><em>Malva species</em></h4>
<p>Mallow plants are a great summertime weed. They grow well in the heat, and unlike many spring greens do not become bitter with all the sun and dry of summertime. They have a mucilaginous texture reminiscent of okra, and can be used for similar purposes in cooking, and in thickening soups. They are also great in fresh salads.</p>
<h3 id="smartweed-aka-redshank">Smartweed (aka Redshank)</h3>
<h4 id="persicaria-maculosa"><em>Persicaria maculosa</em></h4>
<p>Smartweed loves fertile garden soil, and is a prime weed for summer foraging. Young leaves are great in salads, and older leaves can be cooked. The flowers have a fun, unique crunch and make an excellent garnish.</p>
<h3 id="amaranth-aka-pigweed">Amaranth (aka Pigweed)</h3>
<h4 id="amaranthus-species"><em>Amaranthus species</em></h4>
<p>This is a close relative of Quinoa, and the smaller but abundantly produced seeds can be used in similar ways. The easiest use for this is a summertime replacement for spinach - it keeps a mild flavor even when flowering. If grown in the wild garden it can survive and produce just fine without irrigation, but if it has moist soil it will explode with growth.</p>
<h3 id="northern-willowherb">Northern Willowherb</h3>
<h4 id="epilobium-ciliatum"><em>Epilobium ciliatum</em></h4>
<p>This native plant is one of the most prolific volunteers in garden beds, this perennial can form a solid green mat of seedlings. When allowed to overwinter, it will send up crisp buds in early spring that are great for salad, and later in the spring the longer tender shoots can be cooked like asparagus.</p>
<h3 id="lambs-quarters">Lamb’s Quarters</h3>
<h4 id="chenopodium-album"><em>Chenopodium Album</em></h4>
<p>This prolific garden volunteer is tastier than spinach. Really! It has a similar flavor, but most people like it better. It grows in the heat of summer, producing well in poor soil, but really shining in good soil. It can compete head-to-head with domesticated veggies. If you really get into weed gardening, you can even buy commercial seed for a closely related species called “Magenta spreen” that grows larger and has a beautiful magenta color to new growth.</p>
<h3 id="herb-robert">Herb Robert</h3>
<h4 id="geranium-robertianum"><em>Geranium robertianum</em></h4>
<p>This notorious invasive species is often referred to by foragers as “Stinky Bob” because of its rich aroma. It makes a fine seasoning, used similarly to cilantro, and when cooked the aroma completely disappears and only the high nutrition remains. Harvest before it sets seed to control its spread.</p>
<h3 id="cats-ear">Cat’s Ear</h3>
<h4 id="hypochaeris-radicata"><em>Hypochaeris radicata</em></h4>
<p>This weed is most often found plaguing lawns. It is a resilient perennial, capable of weathering drought, foot traffic, compaction, bad soil, and more. It is often found in conditions where it has to bear all that, and it grows low to the ground. If it finds a good home, though, the leaves can grow up to a foot long! The hairy covering on the leaves makes them best as a cooked dish, because the hairs disappear with a little heat and the flavor can shine through.</p>
<h3 id="nipplewort">Nipplewort</h3>
<h4 id="lapsana-communis"><em>Lapsana communis</em></h4>
<p>One of the first weeds to germinate (even in the wintertime!), this can take over a garden bed if one plant is allowed to set seed. If that happens, it can be harvested as baby greens before other spring vegetables are even ready to be planted! Before it bolts it has a mild, spinach-like flavor and can be used fresh in salads or in cooked dishes. When the plants grow together densely the stalks grow long and tender, and can be cooked and eaten as well as the leaves.</p>
<h3 id="pineapple-weed-aka-wild-chamomile">Pineapple Weed (aka Wild Chamomile)</h3>
<h4 id="matricaria-discoidea"><em>Matricaria discoidea</em></h4>
<p>This delightful weed is often a favorite of children. The flowers are shaped like tiny pineapples, and have a pineapple flavor to them too! They are often found growing in gravel. The flowers can be dried to make a delicious tea with a similar calming effect as chamomile.</p>
<h3 id="chickweed">Chickweed</h3>
<h4 id="stellaria-media"><em>Stellaria media</em></h4>
<p>This is a classic favorite weed - its tiny leaves are almost like microgreens, it has a great flavor for fresh eating in salads, and it is also wonderfully at home in an omelette. In gardens it often makes a solid green carpet, but be careful when harvesting that unwanted weeds with similar small leaves don’t get swept along into your harvesting basket!</p>
<h3 id="purslane">Purslane</h3>
<h4 id="portulaca-oleracea"><em>Portulaca oleracea</em></h4>
<p>This low growing weed makes a great ground cover for the summer garden, and is very high in omega-3 fatty acids. In many places this is deliberately grown as a crop! The succulent stems and leaves are eaten together, and with a bit of a salty/sour taste it is great in salads. It can also be used to good effect in soups, which it will help thicken.</p>
