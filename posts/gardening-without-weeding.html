<h1 id="gardening-without-weeding">Gardening without weeding</h1>
<p>Often we come to the garden with a spirit of war. We kill pests, we fight diseases, and probably we more than all we spend time trying to battle back the weeds. The battle has ebbs and flows, but it never ends. For every weed we pull, ten more rise to take its place.</p>
<p>The good news? All that struggle is much closer to being a treadmill than a war. Instead of running in place we can just… stop. Just stop, and find a new dimension of restful peace in the garden.</p>
<h2 id="big-picture-why-are-weeds-so-weedy">Big picture: why are weeds so weedy?</h2>
<p>There are many definitions of what a “weed” is, but the one I like best is “the plants that 9 out of 10 people on the street would call a weed.” In some ways, that is all we need to know. To give a bit of a spoiler, as we walk away from the treadmill and dig our hands into the rich possibilities gardening by ecology, the myriad kinds of “weeds” either recede or are revealed as valuable members of the garden. Much, much more on the nuts and bolts of that later!</p>
<p>But <em>why</em> are some plants so… well, weedy? What makes lovely creatures like dandelions, horsetail and buttercup appear to be such ferocious enemies when we engage them in war?</p>
<h4 id="many-weeds-are-rubble-plants.-whats-a-rubble-plant">Many weeds are rubble plants. What’s a rubble plant?</h4>
<p>Certain plants are brilliantly adapted to serve as rapid-response agents whenever lifegreen is replaced by desolation and emptiness. In nature, this might the grey aftermath of a forest fire, or the pale subsoil revealed by an uprooted tree.</p>
<p>In areas defined by humans, this emptiness of life takes forms like a gravel driveway or a freshly tilled garden.</p>
<p>All of these disturbances open up soil with very little structure to retain water or exchange air. The rich web of life in healthy soil is mostly destroyed, so nutrients leach away and water infiltrates poorly. The lack of lush surrounding growth significantly increases evaporation, as does the increased exposure to sun. Most plants can’t hack it in these conditions. Our garden vegetables only survive because we shower them with water and readily available nutritional amendments.</p>
<p>The rubble plants are diamonds in this rough! They have deep roots to find scarce water and they are frugal with nutrients. They don’t need the support of a healthy soil to gather minerals and thrive and they soak up the burn of the sun without flinching. In the process they provide footholds in many ways for the return of healthy soil and prepare the way for the more diverse plant community that will eventually replace them. They heal the wounds of the earth, starting the successional process towards forest in most areas of this bioregion. The weeds on the side of the road are quite literally a baby old-growth forest in its first year of life.</p>
<p>Dandelions are the posterchild for a rubble plant. They can and do grow in the harshest circumstances, and they throw seed into the sky to rain down <em>everywhere</em>, to guarantee that they will be available when needed.</p>
