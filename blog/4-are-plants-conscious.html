<p>Title: Are Plants Conscious? Date: 2018-03-21 16:43 Author: jpadvo Category: Food Slug: are-plants-conscious Status: published</p>
<p>We really don’t know, and won’t ever be able to know if plants have some kind of experience or consciousness. BUT I do know that we have a systematic tendency to underestimate the level of mental, emotional and spiritual consciousness of anything aside of ourselves.</p>
<p>People enslave other people who look a little different, or are of a different economic class because they are assumed to be lower somehow. For a loooong time we pretended like we were the only species to be able to use tools, which has been repeatedly falsified. We aren’t the only species to use language.</p>
<p>For a long time we told ourselves that fish didn’t feel pain, and that’s been disproven. Elephants carry out mourning ceremonies and bury their dead, and that’s definitely past what animals were supposed to be capable of feeling and expressing.</p>
<p>ALRIGHT, so that’s a bunch of animals. What about other plants?</p>
<p>We know that plants can learn, calculate, remember, move, see, seek, sleep, wake, communicate, and imitate - or at least, they perform actions that we would call those things if they weren’t slow, hard to see with our naked eyes, and didn’t bring up embarrassing ideas about plants being conscious.</p>
<p>If that is hard to swallow, watch this documentary about the modern science:</p>

<p>It can be difficult for us to comprehend how we could possibly relate to plants as conscious. And whatever they are capable of experiencing, theirs is a starkly different world than ours. But I think we are justified in believing that they are truly beings of some kind, and that we will never truly understand them. At least, not in a reductionist way.</p>
<p>Believing this is not only supported by science, but it has the benefit of making the garden an even more magical place to spend time.</p>
