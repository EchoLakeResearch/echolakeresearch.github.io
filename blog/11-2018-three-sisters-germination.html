<p>Title: 2018 three sisters: germination! Date: 2018-06-13 17:33 Author: jpadvo Category: Food Slug: 2018-three-sisters-germination Status: published</p>
<p>Previous post in this series: <a href="./2018-three-sisters-planting-day/">2018 Three sisters: planting day!</a></p>
<p>The mounds are suppressing the reed canary grass quite well. Not 100%, but pretty close and we don’t need perfect 100%.</p>
<p>Something (or somethings?) have been eating a lot of the bean and squash shoots. BUT there are plenty that are completely untouched, so we will definitely be saving seeds from those. These seeds will be the most important yield from the project this year, as they will lay the foundation for success in future years.</p>
<p>Fortunately the precise culprits don’t matter too much to a natural farmer. We will adapt and our seeds will adapt. We’ll save seed from whatever lives, and the survival rate will increase. And we’ll plant more seeds per mound, to increase the likelihood of survivor plants and blind chance leaving us with the numbers we need.</p>
<p>We’ll let the rabbits, coyotes, &amp; hawks and others work out their own population levels.</p>
<p>Years with more rabbits will find us filling out thin mounds with more potatoes. Years with more coyotes and hawks will find us eating more polenta and squash curry.</p>
<p>The corn germination is a bit erratic. It seems that the thinnest mounds have the best germination, and some of the compost is kind of caked, so I suspect that the poor germination of the corn is likely from being planted too deep and getting smothered. It could also be due to dry conditions. We’ll see if the rain we’ve had this week makes more pop up.</p>
<p>I am starting a bunch of goldini zucchini transplants, which we will put out in a few weeks.</p>
<p>We will also be planting potato pull starts (like sweet potato slips) into many of the thin mounds, so we will still get plenty of edible yield from this year. That is another lesson - for resilience, it is important to have various kinds of crops that can be planted at various times, so if one falters you can try again.</p>
