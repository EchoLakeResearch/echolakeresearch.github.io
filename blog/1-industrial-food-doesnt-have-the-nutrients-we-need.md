These numbers are backed by legitimate scientific studies. This is not an exaggerated meme, this is reality. It is impossible to walk into a grocery store and buy food with the nutrition that a person needs to be healthy. Nope, organic is not necessarily any better than conventional.

So what do we do?

Go to a farmer's market, and buy food from somebody who:<span class="text_exposed_show">  
1) claims to have nutrient dense food (or just old fashioned "really good for you"),  
2) can explain \*why\* their food is so good for you, and mentions both variety selection and the soil microbiome, and  
3) has food that tastes really, really good. Our sense of taste is designed to guide us to nutritious food.</span>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
Or grow your own food, using techniques to foster a rich soil ecology. Use no fertilizers except compost and mulch, little or NO tilling, and plenty of locally sourced diy microbial inoculants and cover crops.

We don't have to accept any of this on faith. Assuming regular lab tests to be cost prohibitive for most people, there is a simple alternative. We really do have incredibly sensitive chemical detection capacity in smell and taste. Combine some practice developing that capacity with a refractometer to measure brix, and if the two of them agree that a change supported by scientific literature has increased the quality of the food, then it's a pretty safe bet that it has!

There are many roads you can take to get to the goal. I admin a local group where we talk about this stuff: [PNW Natural Gardening](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pnwnaturalgardening/?fref=mentions&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAY5-E9p4uu7hkocsq_0sVe-ugrAY_sQrPPTzA1ZNeMuZ_IGadS50dZrY6JWov6d6hxFFy3LYGoBdUJcPnzMJ-drx4NMKwlJM3S7j4bmafgJGelhEFbgl6xqjWhbBdZW2pgaLwBbvKO&__tn__=K-R).
