Whenever possible, harvest and thin instead of weeding! We don't just cultivate the land, the land must also cultivate changes in us.

Many of our "worst" weeds <span class="text_exposed_show">are fantastic salad greens or potherbs. Lambsquarters is often tastier than spinach, infinitely easier to grow and often volunteers itself. Chickweed and shotweed are two others that have excellent flavor and texture in the early season. Coming into the heat of summer, wild amaranth and mallow are wonderful.</span>

Many of our other weeds, though, such as plantain, dock, dandelions, cleavers and such can be too tough and bitter for modern tastes. A foraging mentor recently told me that "a little teriyaki sauce in a stir fry fixes anything!".

Other cure alls include a hearty dose of butter and curry powder, or olive oil and cajun seasoning, or schmaltz and herbs provence... you get the idea! Mmmm...

If we allow the land to cultivate our personal cuisine and taste for these wonderful plants, and to cultivate a mindset of gathering when we work the land, then our work becomes lighter and more joyful.

... and in more prosaic terms, it saves money and time and makes us physically healthier. Boom!
