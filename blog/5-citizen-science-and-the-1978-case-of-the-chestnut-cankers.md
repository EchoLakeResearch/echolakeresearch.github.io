Here is an incredible example of natural farming, with lessons for us about science, soil, and the place we have in this world as human beings.

I'll copy-paste <span class="text_exposed_show">the whole 1978 paper below. But the short story is that Wayne Weidlich noticed that cankers of Chestnut Blight did not continue past where the trunk met the soil, but would develop when roots were exposed to air. He hypothesized that soil could treat the cankers, did some experiments and found that it was true! It was that simple.</span>

You can see a modern example of this work  in the American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project group [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/esfchestnut/permalink/1280027362099788/?__xts__[0]=68.ARAxXtXdi3dCooysVDNOldqwcy6BxwaB96aaac2_5pzLKyd8JjgMoGHtxsrRc97dkgjDFcUrV-Qou3r-u0x3BhZSyGrFfNA8a7yyUrI3-hDyWMMvcnJy4GYp38nIPn5_OjqRCxAvwkxk&__tn__=-R).

What I learn from this:

​1. Science is simple. Anyone can do this! Keep your eyes and heart open, to things you see, hear, feel, smell, and dream. When a notion pops into your head, set up an experiment to test the thing. Do the intervention on some samples, and not on others and compare. If it works... you have scientific support for your technique!

​2. Healthy soil is powerful. Many of the microbial inoculants we make are designed to culture up the life from a small sample of soil into a large volume for applications. Those have a very important place. At the same time, we can simply use healthy soil itself to bring life.

​3. Similar practices have arisen all over the world, throughout time. As human beings, we are built for this. We are built to gently tend the land and work with the life of the soil. In the same way that beavers have the instincts to build a dam, or leafcutter ants culture fungi, we have inherent instincts that can guide us to tend the soil and to tend to life. This is a birthright we have largely forgotten, but it is still inside each of us to rediscover and claim as our own.

Let's remember again.

> Below ground portions of chestnut coppice groups do not normally develop cankers. In 1963, I noticed cankers developing on chestnut roots following their exposure to the air during the construction of a logging road. This fact, plus the observation that cankers present on the bases of chestnut trees fail to develop more than a centimeter below the ground level, suggested that soil may exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of E. parasitica cankers. A treatment of active cankers with soil from around the base of the infected tree was found to be effective in causing cankers to go into remission allowing recovery of the infected individual.

> METHOD [edited] Make a soil compress by gathering soil from around the base of an infected chestnut tree [or from any forested area] and mixing it with enough water to cause it to become muddy. Secure a plastic bag with masking tape well below and around a stem with an existing canker. Fill the bag with mud, and secure it around the stem at the top with masking tape. The entire canker should be well covered with mud and the compress should extend beyond the visible area of infection. Leave the bag in place for at least two months.  
>  If a tree has multiple cankers and the stem is less than five inches in diameter, a metal stove pipe can be fitted around the stem and filled with muddy soil. A canker at the base of a tree was treated by simply mounding soil around the base of the tree.
>
> From 1963 to 1975, approximately 50 American chestnut trees in New Hampshire and Massachusetts were treated with soil compresses. In every case, the application was effective in the remission of cankers if the compress was properly applied. Application of air-tight plastic bags without soil or the application of roofing tar as an air-tight barrier instead of a soil compress were not effective.
