If we want our vegetables to be good enough to eat, our soil needs to be good enough to eat. No joke! Read [this article](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/26/17282378/romaine-lettuce-recall-ecoli-yuma)<span class="text_exposed_show"> or the excerpt below.</span>

Actually, even better than that. Like Pedro Jackson of [Cascadian Natural Farming](https://cascadiannaturalfarming.org) talks about, the health of our microbiome isn't just analogous to the soil microbiome... for our health they must be interacting with each other! I want to grow food in dirt that is so healthy it is the best probiotic available on the planet.

The idea that soil can contaminate vegetables comes from a mind-bogglingly flawed paradigm. Contact with soil should always make our food better. Natural farming techniques from ancient times combined with modern science and research let us easily, affordably foster brilliantly vibrant soil.

We shouldn't accept anything less.

From the article:

> Some of the processes farms have in place to clean salads actually trap bacteria in the plants, making them impossible to wash away. “During harvest, workers core lettuce in the field, often with a knife soiled by pathogen-laden dirt,” explained Modern Farmer in an article about why lettuce keeps sickening people. “The plant then produces a milky latex that essentially traps any present pathogens in the plant.”
>
> But contamination can happen “all along the spectrum of growing plants,” Jay-Russell added. “There can be animal intrusions or inputs like contaminated water sources that bring the bacteria into the field.”
>
> There are also types of bacteria that you simply can’t wash off, or the contamination happens in places you typically don’t splash with water, like inside the core of a lettuce head. That can make it pretty hard to prevent food poisoning, even with the triple washing most bagged lettuces go through.
