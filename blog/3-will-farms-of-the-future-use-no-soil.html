<p>Title: Will Farms of the Future Use No Soil? Date: 2018-03-05 15:31 Author: jpadvo Category: Food Slug: will-farms-of-the-future-use-no-soil Status: published</p>
<p>According to this widely circulated video, they won’t use soil! They will use less water, and have a much smaller ecological footprint than old fashioned farms outside in the sun. But of course there is more to the story. Watch the video then read on…</p>

<h1 id="whats-wrong-with-this-picture-it-is">What’s wrong with this picture? It is…</h1>
<p>​1. Ridiculously energy intensive. It takes a massive amount of electricity to grow plants like this, even if they use LEDs. They talk about lower footprint by excluding yellow light from the spectrum? It’s an even lower energy footprint to grow plants outside where the sun provides free lighting.</p>
<p>​2. Heavily based on plastic. Things like estrogen mimicking compounds can be detected in food grown with plastics, so I wouldn’t want to eat much of it. And this guarantees a significant waste stream.</p>
<p>​3. Nutritionally suspect. Rich soils have microbial life that helps mineralize rocks in response to plant needs. This the plants are only fed what is calculated to produce certain desired traits, like a specific flavor profile and MAX YIELD. Good luck getting the right kinds of trace minerals from this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>​4. Expensive! The capital and ongoing costs of this kind of thing are crazy. And they use a marketing story of local, super fresh, clean (i.e. no dirt) to command premium prices. This doesn’t make affordable food, it makes pricy vegetables.</p>
<p>​5. This isn’t an approach to “food”, this is an approach to leafy greens and herbs, and maybe tomatoes. There is no way in heck to grow any kind of calorie crops in a setup like this, only the very highest $ per pound veggies.</p>
<p>​6. We don’t need to use 95% less water. Intelligent management to get healthy soil can significantly reduce water needs already. And if we stopped growing all our vegetables in a desert (California’s central valley) water wouldn’t be nearly as much of an issue anyway.</p>
<p>Videos like this have a really hopeful message of technology coming in and changing our lives, and making everything green and pleasant and sustainable. We want to hear that technology will save us and that we can keep living ever more luxurious lives.</p>
<p>But it’s just not true!</p>
<p>We have problems. We have big problems. And technology like this is at the root of many of them, and will in almost all cases make them worse.</p>
<p>What is hopeful is ways of growing food in soil (even in cities there’s a lot of space to grow fresh food outside!), that ordinary and poor people can participate in. Ways of growing food that actually enhance local ecologies and produce food that can have multiple times as much nutrition as these things.</p>
<p>Those kinds of projects don’t often have the $$$ budgets to spend on fancy videos. And they involve ideas like “manual labor” and “dirt” that are wonderfully healthy for human beings but kind of a culture shock for many modern people to deal with.</p>
<p>As individuals and communities, we can choose to embrace that challenge. To learn to put our hands back in the soil, and to learn how to do a bit of work for our food. Not everyone wants to, but for those who are willing the rewards are immense.</p>
