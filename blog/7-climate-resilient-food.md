Abnormally severe rain sound familiar? Read John Sherck's comments on his pictures below to learn about how he is approaching this problem on his farm (many, ma<span class="text_exposed_show">ny miles from our bioregion but the lessons are sound and the problem is all too familiar). More discussion after this embedded post.</span>

Regardless of politics about climate change, throughout history the climate has always been subject to change. We can all agree to that by simply reading history books. If we want resilient local food systems, we must be learning \*right now\* how to grow food in ways that won't get washed away, disease infested, bug eaten, scorched, or frozen as our bioregion changes around us.

And a good place to start is by mimicking natural ecosystems: living undisturbed soils, organic matter on the surface, abundance of perennial plants, diverse plantings, and design that fits the conditions.

Because the good news is that we don't need to learn how to adapt. We just have to observe how nature works and put the pieces back in place, because nature already knows how to adapt!
