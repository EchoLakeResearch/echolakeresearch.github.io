This thin strip was planted on May 10, with lettuce, spinach, daikon radishes, Joseph Lofthouse's bok choi grex, Chris Homanics's homesteader perennial kale grex, rainbow swiss chard, and komatsuna mustard greens. And Mountaineer perennial rye, Salish Blue and Ezeer perennial wheat. This is planted along a line of serviceberry bushes.

I only watered in the first few days to make sure things germinated. Because we are in a local convergence<span class="text_exposed_show"> zone, despite the fact that our region is in drought we have had quite a bit of rain, so it is extra lush!</span>

The shade will help the lettuce stay nice and sweet as we start having more dryness and heat.[/caption]

I am fast forwarding the succession process from bare soil, to pioneer plants, to grassland, to shrubland. This is done by planting all the stages at once, and harvesting to thin as needed.

Great for pollinators! See the little native bee?[/caption]

Overall I am very, very pleased with the results. I planted later than I would have liked (this has been a crazy year), and slugs did a number on a lot of the baby seedlings, but now you can hardly tell!

Because they were scattered on top, they did not sprout much until the other veggies grew up enough to provide some cool shade that coincided with rain.[/caption]

It's a jungle in there! I could have been thinning this bed a lot more, and probably soon I will harvest a lot of greens to blanch and freeze for convenient cooking later.

Needless to say, I have not needed to weed this. There is no space for weeds!!

Stay tuned for the next veggie bed I'll be planting, though... which will be predominantly host weeds. I'm going to even transplant weeds from my driveway into the new bed. Many of our lowliest weeds are actually the most nutritious, resilient and tasty crops we can grow.

It is hard to tell at this point, but I believe it is one of the wheats. Not pictured is the perennial kale, the other notable long term resident.[/caption]
